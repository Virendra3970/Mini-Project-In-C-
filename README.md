# Mini-Project-In-C++-
In this project, a user can store and display the details of 'n' employees.

There is I want to share my a mini-project in which I've used only two keys Inheritance and Exception Handling. In this project. the user can take the details of 'n' employees and can display the details which are  given below-

Employee's

1-  ID.

2-  Name

3-  Address

4- Phone Number

5- Designation(post)

6- Department 

7- Salary

I've used inheritance concepts to store the details of employee's.

Here, I've noticed some key points that is the :

1- Every employee ID must be unique and greater than zero.

2- Mobile Number must be in 10 digits neither much nor less.

3- Employee Name can contains only space, alphabets(both cases upper and lower)

4- Address can contains space, alphabets(both) and digits only.

5- Salary can contains only digits.

The above 5 key points was handlled by Exception Handling Concept.
